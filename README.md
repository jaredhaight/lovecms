# ❤️CMS

LoveCMS is a CMS for Hugo. I'm writing it because:

1. My partner wants to move off Wordpress
2. I want a little project that I can use to learn Go

# Requirements

I'm *very loosely* tracking requirements and progress through the [❤️CMS Roadmap](https://github.com/users/jaredhaight/projects/1/views/1)
